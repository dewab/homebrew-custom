# My Homebrew Custom Packages

## To use

```% brew tap dewab/custom```

## To install sshpass

```% brew install dewab/custom/sshpass ```

## Package list

### Formulas

**sshpass** -- Because homebrew excludes for security reasons, and I need it occassionally for ansible.

### Casks

**dockutil** -- Need a newer version of dockutil than Homebrew provides for Geerlingguy's dock ansible role.
